# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- What was my motivation?

My key motivation is to learn how to build a web app, and I think this course with Trilogy edX is offering a good starting point and it is also supported by the UK government.

- Why did you build this project?

This project will help to structure my mind, to initially guide me towards the start of the entire programme on web development, and to help those who later might be interested in following the same pathway as mine.

- What problem does it solve?

This study guide solves a few problems: 1) It shows the pathway to get well prepared for the prework study preparation; 2) It also helps to build up on my confidence as this is the first time I am coding to develop a web app, even though I was already exposed to programming/coding in the past.

- What did you learn?

First, I had a beginner exposure to what is html, css, git, and javascript. Second, I had the opportunity to really appreciate if I wanted to get through the full web development programme, and if I like what I am doing.
