# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- What was my motivation?

My key motivation is to learn how to build a web app, and I think this course with Trilogy edX is offering a good starting point and it is also supported by the UK government.

- Why did you build this project?

This project will help to structure my mind, to guide me towards the start of the entire programme on web development, and to help those who might be interested in following the same pathway as mine.

- What problem does it solve?

This study guide solves a few problems: 1) It shows the pathway to get well prepared for the prework study prepartion; 2) It also helps to build up on my confidence as this is first time I am programming to develop a web app, even though I was already exposed to programming/coding in the past.

- What did you learn?

First, I had a beginner exposure to what is html, css, git, and javascript. Second, I had the opoortunity to really appreciate if I wanted to get through the full web development, and if I like what I was doing.


## Installation

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
